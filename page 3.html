      <h1>INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT – AS A PROFESSION
</h1>
	  <br>
	  
	  <hr>
	  <br>
	  <p>The computer revolution continues to generate a flood of data which must be converted into
useful information if security analysis and portfolio management are to flourish. Making
decision is after all, what investment is all about? It seems sensible, therefore, to take
advantage of developments in modern decision theory.
The past two decades has seen increasing professionalization within the fields of SAPM. One
reason is the advent of computers, which help the investment man collect and analyze
Balance Sheet and Income Statement data, make earnings and price projections, and analyze
risk. Investment professionals use these computer outputs to construct portfolios and evaluate
portfolio performance. Since the computer makes quantification of important variables much
easier to achieve, the analyst or manager must understand quantitative techniques and how
they can be used within the field.
In particular, the up-to-date financial analyst must be aware of elementary statistical
techniques, the mathematics of finance, including the concepts of compounded growth,
present values etc, probability theory and other fairly involved subjects. The investment
business is, more complicated today than it has ever been before.
However, that complexity is not the only impetus for greater professionalization among
security analysts and portfolio managers. Another reason is the changing character of the
client, who now-a-days, is much more apt to be an institution or other large, astute investor.
When dealing with such highly sophisticated clients, the security analyst and portfolio
manager can achieve credibility only to the extent that they are through professionals.

<h4>THE PROBLEM OF RISK & RETURN</h4>
<p>
Every investment comes with some amount of risk and every investor wants to maximize the
returns on his investment. Generally, investments with higher risks can only generate higher
returns. Therefore, the investor has to question himself whether he should take higher risk to
earn a higher rate of return. Even if the investor is willing to assume the risk, the question is,
given his profile, can he afford to take very high risks. Often, the investor is confused
between ability to take risks and willingness to take risks. A clear understanding of the two
and application of them into practice is essential for investment discipline.
An investment manager aims to secure the largest possible rate of return at the highest level
of risk an investor is able to assume. Risk means uncertainty about the size of future returns
on a principal amount invested. Rate of return is the relationship between returns realized and
the principal amount invested, usually expressed as an annual rate.
Thus, there are two central concepts of the theory of investment management. One is the
concept of maximizing returns. The rate of return that is realized on the portfolio is the score,
and it is subject to comparison either publicly or privately with scores of other investments.
The second concept states the stability of investors to assume risk limits the efforts to maximize returns. To assume risk is to take the chance of loss as well as the chance of gain.
All investments carry some risk of loss and of gain, but the level of risk varies widely among
the different kinds of securities. Some investors can afford to risk larger losses that others.
The investor needs to build a portfolio with asset class where risks are aligned with the
financial goals. The investor should primarily need to be fully aware of the risk tolerance.
The risk tolerance levels vary between individuals. Financial planning goes beyond stating
investment goals and allocating money into assets. It also involves identifying an investor’s
level of tolerance for risk and then investing money in asset classes that are most aligned to
that level.
Risk profiling is a process that helps investors to assess how much risk they should take while
identifying an asset mix, such that the level of risk is aligned to the stated investment goals.
In other words, risk profiling helps investors determine the variations in returns they can
tolerate in achieving their investment goals. 
</p>

<h3> TYPES OF INVESTORS</h3>
<p>
Conservative investors shall take lower risks and is basically risk averse. The conservative
investor’s basic priority is safety of the capital. He accepts minimal risks and is hence,
prepared to receive minimum or low returns. Investors with such profile should allocate most
of their money into fixed-income and money-market products.
Moderate investors are willing to take slightly higher risks as compared to conservative
investors for a moderate level of return. Investors with this profile can allocate their money in
debt as well as hybrid products like mutual funds, ULIPs etc so that they can earn a moderate
level of income with moderate risks.Aggressive investors are prepared to assume a high level of risk and expects high rate of
return for over a period of 3-5 years. Such investors can park their savings in risky assets like
equity, real estate etc. These instruments yield a high rate of return with a high degree of risk
attached therein.  </p>

<h3> FACTORS AFFECTING RISK TOLERANCE</h3>
<p>
An investor may have lower risk tolerance as they get older. A young investor may take more
risk and be more dynamic as against an elderly investor who may prefer to play safe.
The investor’s family position may also play a role in the risk tolerance level. An investor
who needs to finance his children’s education or take care of his parents or have some
domestic compulsions may have to take lesser risk. An investor who is free from such
domestic compulsions may take higher degree of risks.
Wealth and income of an investor shall determine the risk tolerance level of the investor to a
great extent. In case the investor has higher wealth or income, he shall start investing more
aggressively; and the investor whose wealth or income is relatively less would invest in more
cautious manner.
A mere psychological factor shall also have an impact on the risk tolerance level of an
investor. If the personality of the investor is such that, he is risk averse, he shall take lesser
risk as against the aggressive investor who is ready for some calculated risks.
The level of financial awareness has certainly the impact on the risk tolerance level of an
investor. A financially educated investor is bound to understand the intricacies and take more
risk; whereas an investor who is not financial literate may be risk averse.  
</p>

<h3> RISK – RETURN RELATIONSHIP</h3>
<p>
Risk can be defined as the probability that the actual returns of a security deviates from the
expected return.
There is a positive relationship between the amount of risk assumed in managing a portfolio
of securities and the amount of expected return. In very general terms, the greater the risk, the
larger the expected return and vice-versa.
The investor who is ready to take greater risks shall be compensated with higher returns. An
investor with moderate risk would get moderate returns and the investor who is risk-averse
and takes very little risk shall get only lesser returns. Hence the degree of risk taking ability
shall determine the level of returns.
A strategy has to be built which attempts to balance risk versus reward by adjusting the
percentage of each asset in an investment portfolio according to investor’s risk taking ability,
financial goals and investment time horizon. Investors always expect a good rate of return from their investments. Rate of return could be
defined as the total income the investor receives during the holding period stated as a
percentage of the purchasing price at the beginning of the holding period.

</p>
<h6>Risk</h6>
<p>Risk of holding securities is related with the probability of actual return becoming less than
the expected return. Investment’s risk is just as important as measuring its expected rate of
return because minimizing risk and maximizing the rate of return are interrelated objectives
in the investment management.
An investment whose rate of return varies widely from period to period is risky than whose
return that does not change much. Every investor likes to reduce the risk of his investment by
proper combination of different securities.</p>

<h6>Safety</h6>
<p>The selected investment avenue should be under the legal and regulatory frame work. If it is
not under the legal frame work, it is difficult to represent the grievances, if any. Approval of
the law itself adds flavor of safety. Even though approved by law, the safety of the principal
differs from one mode of investment to another.
</p>
<h6>Liquidity</h6>
<p>Marketability of the investment provides liquidity to the investment. The liquidity depends
upon the marketing and trading facility. If a portion of the investment could be converted into
cash without much loss of time, it would help the investor meet the emergencies. Stocks are
liquid only if they command good market by providing adequate return through dividends
and capital appreciation.

  <h3> PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT</h3>
<p>
Portfolio is the grouping of various financial assets that consists of equity, debt, mutual
funds, exchange traded funds, and real assets like gold, silver, other precious metals, real
estate, etc. Portfolio Management refers to the art and science of making decision with
respect to investment mix or asset allocation, so that the underlying objectives are achieved.
Portfolio management basically is choice of debt v/s equity, domestic v/s international,
growth v/s safety and many other trade-offs encountered in the attempt to maximize the
returns, at the given appetite for risk.
Portfolio management or investment management is the professional management of various
assets, both financial and real assets, in order to meet the specified investment goals for the
benefit of the investors

</p>
  <h3> INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR LIFE CYCLE</h3>
  <p>Financial plans and investment needs are as different as each individual. Investment needs
change over a person’s life cycle. The investment plan should consider the investor’s age,
financial status, future plan, risk aversion characteristics, needs etc.
Before embarking on an investment program, the investor needs to make sure that his three
important needs are satisfied, viz,
 Adequate income to cover living expenses and
 Safety net in case the unexpected could occur
 Cash Reserve

Cash Reserve is quite important to help meet the contingencies and emergencies like job
layoffs, unforeseen expenses, emergence of good investment opportunities, safety cushion
etc. The proportion of cash reserves should also change over the life cycle of the investor.
Assuming that the basic insurance and cash reserve needs are met, individuals can start a
serious investment program with their savings. Due to the changes in net worth and risk
tolerance levels, the individual investor’s investment strategies will change over their life
time. Following is the Individual Investor’s Life Cycle,
